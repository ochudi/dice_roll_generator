# Dice Roll Generator

It’s a fairly simple program that uses the Python random module to replicate the random nature of rolling dice.

I used the os module to clear the screen after you’ve rolled the dice.

You can change the maximum dice value to any number, allowing you to simulate polyhedral dice often used in many board and roleplaying games.

How To?
- Simply run the main.py file.
